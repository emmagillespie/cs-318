                <h4>Stanzas 1-5</h4>
                <p>Hearing I ask | from the holy races,
                    From Heimdall's sons, | both high and low;
                    Thou wilt, Valfather, | that well I relate
                    Old tales I remember | of men long ago.</p> <br>
                <p>I remember yet | the giants of yore,
                    Who gave me bread | in the days gone by;
                    Nine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree
                    With mighty roots | beneath the mold.</p><br>
                <p>Of old was the age | when Ymir lived;
                    Sea nor cool waves | nor sand there were;
                    Earth had not been, | nor heaven above,
                    But a yawning gap, | and grass nowhere.</p> <br>
                <p>Then Bur's sons lifted | the level land,
                    Mithgarth the mighty | there they made;
                    The sun from the south | warmed the stones of earth,
                    And green was the ground | with growing leeks.</p> <br>
                <p>The sun, the sister | of the moon, from the south
                    Her right hand cast | over heaven's rim;
                    No knowledge she had | where her home should be,
                    The moon knew not | what might was his,
                    The stars knew not | where their stations were.</p>
