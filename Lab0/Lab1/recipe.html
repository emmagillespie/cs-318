     <h4>Instructions</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>To soften the potatoes before cooking on the stovetop, place them in a microwave safe bowl with about 1/4 cup of water and microwave on high for 5-6 minutes or until barely fork tender. </li>
            <li>Heat a large heavy skillet over medium high heat and add 2 tablespoons of the ghee. </li>
            <li>Once hot, add the  potatoes and sprinkle all over with sea salt and pepper. Cook about 2 minutes, stir, then cook another 4 minutes, stirring occasionally to evenly brown, until golden brown and tender. </li>
            <li>During the last minute of cooking the potatoes, push them to the size and add the garlic, rosemary, thyme and parsley.</li>
            <li>Stir in with the potatoes and cook until potatoes are done. Once done, remove the potatoes, garlic and herbs to a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and smoked paprika, then add to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Cook over med-high to high heat undisturbed for about 3 minutes or until crisp and brown on one side, then stir and continue to cook until crisp and golden brown all over, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Toss the chicken with the potatoes and top with additional fresh herbs before serving.</li>
