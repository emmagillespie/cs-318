        <h3>Times to pick up donuts</h3>
        <p>The best times to buy donuts are often early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Early in the morning, many donut shops have just finished baking a fresh batch, so you can enjoy a warm, delicious treat that's still at its peak flavor. <br>Plus, this timing often means a wider selection and fewer crowds. Late in the afternoon, especially toward closing time, many bakeries offer discounts on remaining stock to avoid waste. This can be a sweet opportunity to snag some great deals, although the selection might be more limited. For those who love donuts, both times offer unique advantagesâ€”whether it's the freshness and variety of early morning or the potential savings and value of late afternoon.</p>
